# Full-Duplex Spoken Language Models (FD-SLMs)
This is an evolving repo for the survey: From Turn-Taking to Synchronous Dialogue: A Survey of Full-Duplex Spoken Language Models, which is under review at ICASSP 2026. 

This is a survey, but more than a survey â€”â€” due to ICASSP's page limitation, we have omitted and abbreviated many technical details, which are highly valuable for guiding the future implementation of a Full-Duplex Spoken Language Model for practical production. Therefore, we will continue to update relevant content at this link.

If you find our survey useful for your research, please ðŸ“šciteðŸ“š the following paper:
