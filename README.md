# Full-Duplex Spoken Language Models (FD-SLMs)

This is an evolving Github repository for the paper: [From Turn-Taking to Synchronous Dialogue: A Survey of Full-Duplex Spoken Language Models [2509.14515]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14515), which is under review at ICASSP 2026. In this paper, we survey the field of Full-Duplex Spoken Language Models (FD-SLMs), which enable synchronous humanâ€“AI dialogue via simultaneous speaking and listening, achieving a more realistic human-computer interaction experience.

**Update (October 31)** 

This repository will now receive regular updates to maintain the most current survey content.

I recently participated in the [ICASSP HumDial Challenge](https://aslp-lab.github.io/HumDial-Challenge/), which temporarily delayed updates to this repository. However, this experience provided valuable insights into full-duplex implementation, particularly regarding modular approaches.

Additionally, several recent full-duplex papers have been published, such as FLM-Audio[[2509.02521]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02521), and will be incorporated into upcoming updates.

This is a survey, but more than a survey â€”â€” due to ICASSP's page limitation, we have omitted and abbreviated many technical details, which are highly valuable for guiding the future implementation of a Full-Duplex Spoken Language Model for practical production. Therefore, we will continue to update relevant content at this link.

If you find our survey useful for your research, please ðŸ“šciteðŸ“š the following paper:
